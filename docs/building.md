# Building and running Redivivus

## You need

- Your own installation of Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, version 1.14. This repository
  contains no game data and no Blizzard binaries; the executable reads the MPQ archives
  from your installation. If you have no installation at hand,
  [blizzard-legacy-dl](https://github.com/jaenster/blizzard-legacy-dl) downloads the
  installers from Blizzard's own servers:

  ```sh
  blizzard-legacy-dl fetch D2DV -o ./d2     # Diablo II
  blizzard-legacy-dl fetch D2XP -o ./d2     # Lord of Destruction
  ```

  You still need your own CD keys to install.
- To build: a mingw-w64 cross compiler for 32-bit Windows (`i686-w64-mingw32-g++`), CMake
  and Ninja.
  - macOS: `brew install mingw-w64 cmake ninja`
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install g++-mingw-w64-i686 cmake ninja-build`
  - Windows: an MSYS2 MinGW32 shell

## Build

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/mingw-i686.cmake
cmake --build build
```

That produces `build/d2.exe`, a 32-bit Windows executable. `tools/check-build.sh` does
the same from a clean clone and checks the result; CI runs it on every push.

## Run

Copy `d2.exe` into your Diablo II folder, next to the original `Game.exe`, and
start it from there:

```
d2.exe -w
```

`-w` runs it in a window.
